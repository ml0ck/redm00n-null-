RedMoon Security Tool - Abandoned Project

RedMoon Security Tool is an open-source security auditing tool designed to provide various security scans, from host and vulnerability detection to advanced injection testing. This project was created as a comprehensive suite to help security professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers assess the security posture of websites, networks, and servers.
How it Works:

RedMoon integrates multiple well-known security tools into a single interface, allowing users to run scans using popular command-line utilities such as:

    Nmap for network scanning
    Nikto for web vulnerability scanning
    SQLMap for SQL injection testing
    Commix for command injection testing
    WhatWeb, Whois, Dig, and more.

The tool works by allowing users to input a target IP, URL, or domain. Once the target is entered, users can select from a list of available tools. Each selected tool runs in a separate thread and outputs results to a dedicated console window in real time.
Key Features:

    Command Execution: Run security scans from various tools like Nikto, Nmap, SSLScan, and more.
    Multi-tool Interface: Run multiple scans simultaneously for in-depth security analysis.
    Open-Source: The source code is available for anyone to review, modify, or contribute to.
    GUI-based: A user-friendly graphical interface made with Tkinter to easily select and execute scans.
